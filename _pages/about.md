I help organizations build better software to change people's lives for the better.

Through this blog, I share essays on software delivery, leadership, and the mental models that drive effective teams. My writing focuses on the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what."

## Focus Areas

- Software requirements and the intent gap
- Leadership and team dynamics
- Time management and prioritization
- Building sustainable software practices
