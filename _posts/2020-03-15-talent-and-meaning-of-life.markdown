Hard work beats talent. That's what a quick Google search will tell you. There's even a moral story to support it: the race between the tortoise and the hare. 

>The hare, a natural talent at running who thought could win the race at any time, decides to take a nap. The tortoise, a hard worker with zero talent, pushes through and wins the race.

Slow and steady wins the race. My little one loves the story but I don't for a few reasons. 

1. If the rabbit is actually a talent at running, she would rather be running than taking a nap. 
2. The whole argument between talent and hard work is too simplistic and leaves aside the [influence of luck](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-success-come-mostly-from-talent-hard-work-mdash-or-luck/). In an analogy with poker, talent and hard work are just the things that keep you at the table until you get lucky.
3. And above all, hard work and talent are just the same: _traits_. They're both given to us by either genetics, our environment or a [combination of both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics).

There's no reason to brag about our hard work, talent or even courage because we did nothing to receive them.

## The Big Questionâ€‹
I'm not a religious person but always wondered what are we doing here. Not an original question and it seems we [need explanations](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/why-we-wonder-why/) for everything. So [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) comes to the rescue. But it turns out the Big Question is tough so there's even a [dilemma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/philosophy-dispatches/201111/the-teleologists-dilemma-life-has-no-purpose?collection=81244) around it.

Religion, philosophy and even science provided many [popular views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life#Popular_views) for the [meaning of life](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/). The good news is that we'll never know if there's a correct answer to the question. So you get to pick the one you like the most and move on.

## A little bit about myself
I'm a pragmatic guy who likes simple solutions. So I have a couple of problems with all those answers:

*   They're a bit too abstract. I need more tangible things.
*   Most of them are centered around oneself. It's hard for me to believe we're not part of a larger plan. And I'm selfish enough without anyone telling me to do so.

It's not frequent that I have an original idea. My brain seems to run a couple of processes. One collects what looks like useless information. A fancy name for this is _Input_, which is one of my top 3 strengths according to [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx). Another process receives problems and tries to solve them. More often than not, solutions are a mashup of useless things in store. You can call them _The Frankensteins_ or _Ideation_, another of my top 3 strengths. 

Note I'm using the word _process_ and never mention _threads_. One processing unit, two processes, zero concurrency up there. My loving wife always has a hard time getting that.

## The case for talent
There's a very strong case for _hard work_ so I'll put myself on the side of _talent_ for a moment. I believe talent can provide a simple answer to the Big Question.

Let's say you send someone or something on a mission. To maximize chances of success, you provide them with the [equipment](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/summary/) they need to complete it. Makes sense so far?

Can we consider our talents, and even our ideas, as the **equipment we need to complete our mission**? Doesn't it sound like the best proxy we have? Then it's our responsibility to make the best use of them.

And there you have one of my few original ideas. There's a high chance for it to be yet another of _The Frankesteins_ but, at least, I don't remember collecting it somewhere else.

## Find your talents and use them
That's a simple concept, right? The bad news is that talent, many times, goes unnoticed. Isn't it funny that a music teacher had in his room [half of The Beatles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLbXrNGVXfE) and didn't see any talent in them? 

The good news is that it seems like using our talents [makes us happy](https://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/1531865208). It makes sense if you think about it:

*   You have a mission.
*   You send someone to complete it but don't tell them so.
*   You give them some equipment.
*   To make sure they use them, you [make them happy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/200904/the-wisdom-spontaneity-part-5) when they do it.

Simple in concept, same as reproduction. For some reason, the use of our talents didn't make it to the base of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) but to the top instead. Way easier to left talents behind then.

Finding your talents is your best investment. If you find yourself not working _hard enough_, I would look at how your tasks relate to your talents before anything else. To get lucky, you need to be sitting at the table.

After all, when checking out, the use of our talents could measure the success of our stay here. My current balance is not something to brag about so I made a vow to myself. Making the best use of my talents will be the main driver for my decisions moving forward.

I invite you to do the same.
