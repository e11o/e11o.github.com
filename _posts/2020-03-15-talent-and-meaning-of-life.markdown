I believe hard work is overrated. Since we're born, we're kept in check with a sophisticated network of mechanisms that prevent laziness from creeping in. The seriousness spectrum is broad and ranges from things like Sloth, one of the deadly sins, to seemingly innocuous moral stories, like the race between the tortoise and the hare. The hare, a natural talent at running who thought could win the race at any time, decides to take a nap. The tortoise, a hard worker with zero talent, pushes through and wins the race. Slow and steady wins the race, who cares about talent.

The thing is that talent and hard work are equally important to success, even when they don't guarantee it. Please don't be fooled and think that not seeing the results you expect is because you don't have the talent or you are not putting the hard work in. Like it or not, there's a large [influence of luck](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-success-come-mostly-from-talent-hard-work-mdash-or-luck/). In an analogy with poker, talent and hard work are able to keep you sitting at the table when you're not lucky. But you need luck to win the game.

The bigger point is hard work and talent are just _traits_. They're given to us either by genetics, our environment or a [combination of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics). Please stop bragging about your hard work or talent, we did very little to receive them.

## Using our talents makes us happy

Things will get hairy very quickly for hard work fans.

When you use your talents, the definition of hard work starts blurring: work might not even feel like work. I sometimes find myself very late at night working on some piece of code that is not even part of my job. You lose sense of time when you're enjoying what you're doing, it feels more like play. If you enjoy it to this level, is it still hard work? Would the hare rather be running than taking a nap?

[Very smart people](https://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/1531865208) studied talents for a long time and, apparently, using them [makes us happy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-the-self/200904/the-wisdom-spontaneity-part-5). Positive reinforcement is the fancy name of this simple concept, which has a successful track record for reproduction. But the use of talents made it to the top of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html), which sounds more exclusive but actually makes it easier for talents to receive less attention.

## Are talents the answer to the Big Question?

And now we go into esoteric territory.

I believe talent can provide a simple, pragmatic answer to the Big Question: why are we here? Religion, philosophy and even science provided many [popular views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life#Popular_views) for the [meaning of life](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/life-meaning/). Answering the Big Question is the reason for teleology to exist, but it's so hard a question that it created a [dilemma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/philosophy-dispatches/201111/the-teleologists-dilemma-life-has-no-purpose?collection=81244).

So here comes my simplistic attempt to answering it.

Let's say someone is sent on a mission. To maximize chances of success, it only makes sense to provide them with the [specific equipment](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/spacecraft/instruments/summary/) they need to complete the mission.

Are then our talents, and even our ideas, the equipment we need to complete our mission? Is positive reinforcement a mechanism to make sure we complete our mission? For stoicists, it will resonate with the concept of duty.

## Go find your talents and put them to good use

If the theory above makes sense, it's our responsibility to make the best use of our talents.

The bad news is that talent, many times, goes unnoticed. Isn't it ironic that a music teacher had in his room [half of The Beatles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLbXrNGVXfE) and didn't see any talent in them? 

Finding your talents may probe to be your best investment. If you find yourself not working _hard enough_, I would take a deep look at how your tasks relate to your talents.

After all, when checking out, how we use our talents could measure the success of our stay here. And, in the meantime, our life is going to be a happier one.

When you get lucky, you better be at the table.
