# estebansancho.com — Blog Platform & Theme Decision Report

**Date:** January 2026
**Author:** Esteban Sancho
**Scope:** Personal blog platform, theme selection, and publishing approach for long-form essays

---

## 1. Objective

Establish a durable, high-quality publishing setup for long-form, idea-driven writing (e.g. *The Intent Gap in Software Requirements*) that:

* Maximizes readability and credibility
* Feels calm, serious, and timeless
* Is easy to maintain and publish via GitHub
* Supports gradual growth into an essay archive rather than a “dev blog”

---

## 2. Constraints & Non-Goals

### Constraints

* Must be supported by **GitHub Pages**
* Prefer static generation (no runtime backend)
* Low operational overhead
* Content-first (no heavy UI or interactivity)

### Explicit Non-Goals

* Chasing visual novelty or theme personality
* Optimizing for comments or social engagement
* Over-branding or “personal homepage” theatrics

---

## 3. Platform Evaluation

### Considered Options

| Option                      | Evaluation                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current custom Jekyll setup | Too minimal, lacks navigation, archives, and modern reading UX          |
| Hugo / Eleventy             | Strong technically, but adds migration friction with no decisive upside |
| Jekyll (modern theme)       | Best balance of simplicity, GitHub Pages support, and maturity          |

### Decision

**Stay on Jekyll**, but adopt a modern, essay-friendly theme.

Rationale:

* Native GitHub Pages support
* Mature ecosystem
* Minimal operational complexity
* Easy future extensibility (TOC, tags, archives)

---

## 4. Theme Selection

### Candidates Evaluated

* Minimal Mistakes
* Chirpy
* Just the Docs

### Decision

**Minimal Mistakes** selected as the base theme.

**Why Minimal Mistakes**

* Excellent long-form readability
* Proven stability
* Built-in support for:

  * Tags and categories
  * Table of contents
  * Author metadata
  * Archives
* Fully compatible with GitHub Pages via `remote_theme`

Chirpy was rejected due to heavier build requirements.
Just the Docs was rejected due to its documentation-first aesthetic.

## 5. Skin (Visual Style) Decision

### Skins Evaluated

* Air
* Contrast
* Dark
* Dirt / Mint / Aqua / Sunrise
* Neon / Plum

### Decision

**Contrast skin (default)**

### Rationale

* Best readability for long essays
* Neutral, editorial tone
* Lets typography and structure carry authority
* Ages well over time
* Aligns with a “quiet, serious thinker” aesthetic

**Explicit rejections**

* Air: too default / starter-blog feel
* Dark: polarizing, weaker for long reading
* Colored skins: add unnecessary personality
* Neon / Plum: demo skins, not essay environments

Optional future enhancement:

* Offer Dark as a *reader-controlled toggle*, not default

---

## 6. Content Model Decisions

### Article Structure

Each essay will be conceptually split into two layers:

**Layer 1 — Public Essay**

* Clear hook
* Structured argument
* Strong conclusion
* Designed to be read linearly

**Layer 2 — Notes / Research (Optional)**

* Development notes
* Research questions
* Outlines and tangents
* Either:

  * Collapsible (`<details>`), or
  * Separate linked page

This preserves intellectual rigor without diluting the reading experience.

---

## 7. Post Layout Decisions

* Layout: `single`
* Optional Table of Contents for long posts
* Minimal or no sidebar on articles
* Focus on line length, spacing, and hierarchy
* Comments not required initially

Interaction model:

* Essays stand on their own
* Responses handled via direct outreach or external platforms

---

## 8. Navigation & Site Structure (Planned)

Minimum viable structure:

* `/` — latest essays
* `/about` — writing focus and credibility
* `/posts` — full archive
* `/topics` — tag-based exploration
* RSS feed enabled

---

## 9. Next Implementation Steps

1. Switch site to **Minimal Mistakes (remote_theme)**
2. Set skin to **contrast**
3. Configure basic navigation (home, about, posts, topics)
4. Publish *The Intent Gap* using the new structure
5. Remove legacy elements (unused social links, outdated sharing)

---

## 10. Summary

The chosen setup intentionally prioritizes:

* Readability over personality
* Authority over novelty
* Longevity over trends

**Final stack**

* Platform: Jekyll
* Theme: Minimal Mistakes
* Skin: Contrast
* Content style: long-form essays, editorial tone

This creates a publishing home designed to be referenced, reread, and trusted.

**Status:** Decisions finalized
**Next action:** Implement theme + publish first flagship essay
